you can eat from the pot,” said Hymir expansively. The strangers were
Small, after all—how much could they eat? After all, the oxen were
enormous.

"Thor said he didn't mind if he did, and he proceeded to devour two
of the oxen all by himself, one after the other, leaving nothing but
clean-picked bones. Then he belched in a satisfied way.

“That's a lot of food, Veor,” sald Hymir, “It was meant to feed us for
‘several days. I do not think I have ever seen even a giant eat two of my
oxen at once before.”

“1 was hungry,” sald Thor. “And I got a little carried away. Look,

1 already have my own bait,” said Hymir. “You must find your own.
‘You could look in the field of the axen for it. Nice big maggots in the ox
dung, after all. Bring whatever you want from there.”

“Thor looked at Hymir. He thought about hitting Hymir with his
hammer, but then he would never get the cauldron, not without a fight.
He walked back up the shore.

Th the meadow was Hymir’s herd of beautiful oxen. There were giant
patties of dung on the ground, with huge maggots writhing and

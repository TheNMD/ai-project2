you can eat from the pot,” said Hymir expansively. The strangers were
Small, after all—how much could they eat? After all, the oxen were
enormous.

“Thor said he didn’t mind if he did, and he proceeded to devour two
of the oxen all by himself, one after the other, leaving nothing but
clean-picked bones. Then he belched in a satisfied way.

“That's a lot of food, Veor,” said Hymir. “It was meant to feed us for
‘several days. 1 do not think I have ever seen even a giant eat two of my
‘oxen at once before.”

“| was hungry,” said Thor. “And I got a little carried away. Look,
tomorrow, why don't we go out fishing? I hear you are quite a

Hymir prided himself on his skills at fishing. “I am an excellent

are we using for balt?™

“Lalready have my own bait,” sald Hymir. “You must find your own.
You could look in the field of the oxen for it. Nice big maggots in the ox
dung, after all. Bring whatever you want from there.”

‘Thor looked at Hymir. He thought about hitting Hymir with bis
hammer, but then he would never get the cauldron, not without a fight.
He walked back up the shore.

In the meadow was Hymir’s herd of beautiful oxen. There were giant
patties of dung on the ground, with huge maggots writhing and
burrowing in them, but Thar avoided all of them. Instead he walked
over to the biggest, most majestic, fattest of the beasts, raised his fist,
